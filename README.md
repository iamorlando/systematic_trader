In order to run the code *as is* you will need an API key for downloading market data from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Once you have a key create a file called `env.py` and place it in the project root.

the contents of env.py should be:

```(python)
API_KEY = {Your API Key}
```
